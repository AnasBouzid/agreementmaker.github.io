title: AgreementMaker turns 21 ...

… well, not quite.

I am happy to announce a new AgreementMaker release, version *0.21*. There are several bugfixes (some quite annoying), plus two new features:

* "The SEALS Interface":https://github.com/agreementmaker/agreementmaker.github.io/wiki/SEALS-Interface  – just in time for the first OAEI deadline.
* "WordNet Lookup":https://github.com/agreementmaker/agreementmaker.github.io/wiki/WordNet-Lookup – when you need to debug your WordNet matcher.

I strongly recommend everyone upgrade from version 0.2, since there were a few usability bugs fixed. For the developers working with AgreementMaker in Eclipse, you will just need the updated jar.
