AgreementMaker was demo-ed today at the International Conference on Biomedical
Ontology. I want to thank everyone that attended, I hope it was a good
introduction to AgreementMaker.

The "short slides I presented":http://cdn.agreementmaker.org/web/files/AgreementMaker-ICBO-demo-slides.pdf
are now online. Not much to see there, but just in case people were interested in the slides.

*Update:* Thank you to all the people that are interested in AgreementMaker.
If I didnâ€™t get a chance to speak with you, please feel free to contact me
directly (cstroe1 AT cs DOT uic DOT edu).
